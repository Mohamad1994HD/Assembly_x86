1)       
 Write a program to calculate the total sum of 5 Bytes
 of data. Each byte represents the daily wages of a worker. 
 This person does not make more than 255$ aday.
 data is: 125, 235, 197, 91, 48


2)
Assume the following two arrays
X= 15, 24,  1, 12, 14, 11, 23, 22, 16, 12
Y= 12, 23, 28, 19, 15, 19, 25, 18, 26, 21
Write  a program that calculate Z according
Z= SUM (Xi-Yi)

3)
Assume A,B arrays of bytes size = 7
Calculate the sum of each one elements and
save the answer into memroy
